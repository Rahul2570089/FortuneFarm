Since this project will hold both the client application and the server application there will be node modules in two different places. First run `npm install` from the root. After this you will run `npm run-script install-all` from the root. From now on run this command anytime you want to install all modules again. This is a script we have defined in package.json .

This app can be deployed directly to Google Cloud and AMD instance since there is a script defined in package.json which will automatically handle building and deploying the app.
